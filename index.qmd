title: "Increasing NYC Taxi Drivers Earnings"
---

## Problem description

**Opportunity**

Taxi drivers could **increase their earnings** by changing their strategy.

**Questions to solve**

- How much a taxi driver can increase its monthly earning just by **skipping trips under defined conditions**?
- How much a taxi driver can increase its monthly earning just by **changing its initial zone and time**?

**Business success criteria**

Develop a strategy to **increase** NYC taxi drivers' monthly earnings **by 20%**.

**Project scope**

This project will be limited to **Juno**, **Uber**, **Via** and **Lyft** taxi drivers who work in New York City in trips that take place between any zone of **Manhattan**, **Brooklyn** or **Queens** (the more active ones).

## Metodology

To solve those questions we are going to use use the **Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining** (CRISP-DM).

And based on this steps we can organize the articles created in this portfolio web site.

## Data to use

In this project, we will use a subset of the data available in the [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) from 2022 to 2023 for **High Volume For-Hire Vehicle** with the columns described in its [data dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_hvfhs.pdf).

## Disclaimer 

This project was completed by making strong assumptions due the reality that the data used to create the analysis don't provide any unique identifier for taxi drivers, that could help us to deliver more realistic results.

On the other hand, this project aims to increase **taxi driver earnings**, regardless that if we apply it extensively, it could also end producing the following results:

1.  **Reduced service quality:** Drivers focusing solely on maximizing earnings may avoid less profitable areas or times, potentially leaving some passengers underserved.

2.  **Increased congestion:** Drivers congregating in high-profit areas could worsen traffic in already busy parts of the city.

In conclusion, this project was created to show my abilities as Data Scientist, but it is not a project that should be implemented due this considerations.
