They can start to work:\n\n    -   From any zone of Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens (the more active ones)\n    -   From any month, weekday or hour.\n\n2.  The TLC license number (taxi company) needs to keep constant for all trips in workday.\n\n3.  Only wheelchair-accessible vehicles can accept trips with that request.\n\n4.  As we cannot estimate whether each zone have more active taxis than passengers we will assume that there is always more passengers than taxis and each taxi driver can **accept the first requested trip**.\n\n5.  The taxis will find trips based on their time waiting and will take the first trip in their valid radius:\n\n    -   0-1 Minute: Search within a 1-mile radius.\n\n    -   1-3 Minutes: Expand search to a 3-mile radius if no trip is found.\n\n    -   3-5 Minutes: Expand search to a 5-mile radius if still no trip is found.\n\n    -   Keep adding 2 miles every two minutes until finding a trip.\n\n6.  They have a 30 minutes break after 4 hours working once ending the current trip.\n\n7.  They will take their last trip after working 8 hours, without taking into consideration the 30 minutes break.\n\n\n## Running trips simulation\n\n1.  Loading the functions to use.\n\n```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(infer)\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n## Custom functions\ndevtools::load_all()\n\noptions(datatable.print.nrows = 15)\n```\n\n2.  Creating folders to save data on disk.\n\n```{r}\nif(!dir.exists(here(\"output\"))) dir.create(here(\"output\"))\nif(!dir.exists(here(\"output/take-trip-fst\"))) dir.create(here(\"output/take-trip-fst\"))\nif(!dir.exists(here(\"output/cache-data\"))) dir.create(here(\"output/cache-data\"))\n```\n\n3.

Selecting at random the first trip of each simulation.
