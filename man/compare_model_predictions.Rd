\usage{
compare_model_predictions(
  predictions_df,
  model_col,
  model1_name,
  model2_name,
  truth_col = "take_current_trip",
  pred_class_col = ".pred_class",
  pivot_wider_id_cols = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions_df}{A data frame containing predictions from multiple models.
Must include columns for model identifier, truth values, and predicted classes.}

\item{model_col}{Character string specifying the column name that identifies
which model made each prediction.}

\item{model1_name}{Character string specifying the name/identifier of the first
model to compare.}

\item{model2_name}{Character string specifying the name/identifier of the second
model to compare.}

\item{truth_col}{Character string specifying the column name containing the true
outcome values. Default is \code{"take_current_trip"}.}

\item{pred_class_col}{Character string specifying the column name containing the
predicted class values. Default is \code{".pred_class"}.}

\item{pivot_wider_id_cols}{Character vector specifying the column names to use
as identifiers when pivoting the data wider. These columns uniquely identify
each observation and are preserved in the output. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\describe{
\item{correct_model}{Category indicating which model(s) were correct:
the first model name, second model name, "Both Correct", or "Both Incorrect"}
\item{n}{Count of observations in each category}
\item{percentage}{Percentage of observations in each category, formatted as text}
}
The data frame is sorted by count in descending order.
}
\description{
This function compares the prediction performance of two models by calculating
how often each model is correct, both are correct, or both are incorrect.
}
\details{
The function filters the predictions to include only the two specified models,
determines correctness by comparing predicted classes to truth values, and then
categorizes each observation based on which model(s) predicted correctly.

# Compare logistic regression vs random forest models
