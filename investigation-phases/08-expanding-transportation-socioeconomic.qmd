Expanding on the previous post's geospatial feature extraction, this article will delve into enriching our understanding of NYC taxi zones with socioeconomic and transportation-related data from the **American Community Survey (ACS)**. This new layer of information will provide crucial context for analyzing `take_current_trip` by revealing underlying community characteristics and commuting behaviors within each zone.

Here are the steps to follow:

1.  **Import ACS data**:
    * Identify relevant ACS variables for:
        * Means of transportation to work.
        * Travel time to work.
        * Household income.
        * Geographical mobility.
    * Download ACS data for NYC census tracts.

2.  **Spatially join ACS data to taxi zones**:
    * Perform spatial joins to aggregate census tract data to the taxi zone level.
    * Address overlapping and partially contained tracts.

3.  **Extract new features**:
    * Calculate proportions, averages, and densities of the ACS variables for each taxi zone.

4.  **Validation**:
    * Integrate new features with existing data and `take_current_trip`.
    * Define the correlation between new predictors and `take_current_trip`.
    
    
## Setting up the environment

### Define colors to use

```{r}
BoroughColors <- c(
  'Manhattan' = '#e41a1c',
  'Queens' = '#377eb8',
  'Brooklyn'= '#4daf4a'
)

BoroughSelected <- names(BoroughColors)

ColorHighlight <- "lightslateblue"
ColorGray <- "gray80"
```

### Define features to import



### Loading packages

```{r}
## To manage relative paths
library(here)

## To transform data that fits in RAM
library(data.table)
library(tidytext)

## To work with spatial data
library(sf)

## To create interactive maps
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")

# Access to US Census Bureau datasets
library(tidycensus)

## To create general plots
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

:::{.callout-note title="Computational Performance"}
The geospatial processing operations in this document are computationally intensive. Although they could benefit from parallelization with packages like `future` and `future.apply`, we've opted for a sequential approach with caching via `qs2`  to maximize **reproducibility** and maintain **code simplicity**. Intermediate results are saved after each costly operation to avoid unnecessary recalculations during iterative development.

## Import data

Details on how this data was obtained can be found in the **Data Collection Process**.

```{r}

                   n_char = nchar(basename(x)),
                   name = basename(x)))() |>
  (\(dt) dt[order(n_char, name), full_path])() |>
  head(12L) |>

### Getting data from API

### Saving the data

```r
qs2::qs_save(OsmDataComplete, 
             here("output/cache-data/OsmDataComplete.qs"))
```


## Spatial joins

We perform two main types of spatial joins to associate the OpenStreetMap features with our taxi zones: first, to identify features entirely within each zone, and second, to identify features that intersect or overlap with the zone boundaries.

### Joining elements **contained** by each zone

Using the `st_within` function, this section identifies OpenStreetMap featuresâ€”such as points, lines, polygons, multilinestrings, and multipolygonsâ€”that are **fully contained** within each taxi zone's boundaries. `st_within` considers multilinestrings and multipolygons to be within a zone only if all their constituent parts are inside.

```r
PolygonWithinZones <-
  OsmDataComplete$osm_polygons |>
  st_join(y = ZonesShapes,
          join = st_within,
          left = FALSE)
```


### Joining lines that are **partially contained** for each zone. 

In this section, we identify OSM features that are not entirely within a taxi zone but do intersect or overlap with its boundary. For lines and multilinestrings, we use `st_crosses`, which identifies features that intersect the interior of a zone but are not completely contained within it. For polygons and multipolygons, we use `st_overlaps`, which identifies features that have some area in common with a zone but are not identical to or completely contained within it.

```r
PolygonInSeveralZones <-
  OsmDataComplete$osm_polygons |>
  st_join(y = ZonesShapes,
          join = st_overlaps,
          left = FALSE)
```
